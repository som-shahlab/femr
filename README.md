# FEMR
### Framework for Electronic Medical Records

**FEMR** is a Python package for manipulating longitudinal EHR data for machine learning, with a focus on supporting the creation of foundation models and verifying their [presumed benefits](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/how-foundation-models-can-advance-ai-healthcare) in healthcare. Such a framework is needed given the [current state of large language models in healthcare](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/shaky-foundations-foundation-models-healthcare) and the need for better evaluation frameworks.

The currently supported foundation models are [CLMBR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05295.pdf) and [MOTOR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03150).

**FEMR** works with data that has been converted to the [MEDS](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard/) schema, a simple schema that supports a wide variety of EHR / claims datasets. Please see the MEDS documentation, and in particular its [provided ETLs](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard/meds_etl) for help converting your data to MEDS.

# Installation

```bash
pip install femr

# If you are using deep learning, also run...
pip install xformers
```
# Getting Started

The first step of using **FEMR** is to convert your patient data into [MEDS](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard), the standard input format expected by **FEMR** codebase.

The best way to do this is with the [ETLs provided by MEDS](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard/meds_etl).

## OMOP Data

If you have OMOP CDM formated data, follow these instructions:

1. Download your OMOP dataset to `[PATH_TO_SOURCE_OMOP]`.
2. Convert OMOP => MEDS using the following:
```bash
# Convert OMOP => MEDS data format
meds_etl_omop [PATH_TO_SOURCE_OMOP] [PATH_TO_OUTPUT_MEDS]
```

3. Use HuggingFace's Datasets library to load our dataset in Python
```bash
import datasets
dataset = datasets.Dataset.from_parquet(PATH_TO_OUTPUT_MEDS + 'data/*')

# Print dataset stats
print(dataset)
>>> Dataset({
>>>   features: ['patient_id', 'events'],
>>>   num_rows: 6732
>>> })

# Print number of events in first patient in dataset
print(len(dataset[0]['events']))
>>> 2287
```

## Stanford STARR-OMOP Data

If you are using the STARR-OMOP dataset from Stanford (which uses the OMOP CDM), we add an initial Stanford-specific preprocessing step. Otherwise this should be identical to the **OMOP Data** section. Follow these instructions:

1. Download your STARR-OMOP dataset to `[PATH_TO_SOURCE_OMOP]`.
2. Convert STARR-OMOP => MEDS using the following:
```bash
# Convert OMOP => MEDS data format
meds_etl_omop [PATH_TO_SOURCE_OMOP] [PATH_TO_OUTPUT_MEDS]_raw

# Apply Stanford fixes
femr_stanford_omop_fixer [PATH_TO_OUTPUT_MEDS]_raw [PATH_TO_OUTPUT_MEDS]
```

3. Use HuggingFace's Datasets library to load our dataset in Python
```bash
import datasets
dataset = datasets.Dataset.from_parquet(PATH_TO_OUTPUT_MEDS + 'data/*')

# Print dataset stats
print(dataset)
>>> Dataset({
>>>   features: ['patient_id', 'events'],
>>>   num_rows: 6732
>>> })

# Print number of events in first patient in dataset
print(len(dataset[0]['events']))
>>> 2287
```
