    "\n",
    "We will define a set of patients who have a unique set of associated clinical events, and then initialize a Piton dataset with this data. \n",

    "The **piton** workflow of creating patient timelines from an EHR dataset is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract clinical events from the source EHR database. This could be OMOP-CDM, MIMIC-III, eICU, etc.\n",
    "    * This code is specific to the source EHR database, and is not covered in this tutorial.\n",
    "    * We have already written extractors for some popular EHR databases in the `src/piton/extractors` folder.\n",
    "2. Write these extracted events to disk as an `EventCollection`. \n",
    "    * In an abstract sense, an `EventCollection` is simply an unordered list of `(Patient ID, Event)` tuples. \n",
    "    * Internally, **piton** will shard these tuples across a set of files on disk that will be stored in a single folder, but you don't need to worry about that.\n",
    "3. Transform the `EventCollection` into a `PatientCollection`. \n",
    "    * In an abstract sense, a `PatientCollection` is a **sorted** list of `(Patient ID, Event)` tuples, where the sorting is done first by `Patient ID`, second by the `start` time of each `Event`. \n",
    "    * Internally, **piton** will shard these consecutively arranged tuples across a set of files on disk that will be stored in a single folder, but you don't need to worry about that.\n",
    "4. Apply transformations to your patient timelines (e.g. move coding assignments to the end of their visits, move all events before a patient's birthdate to after their birthdate, etc.) that you want to your `PatientCollection` to generate a new `PatientCollection`.\n",
    "5. Index and save your `PatientCollection` to disk as a `PatientDatabase`.\n",
    "    * In an abstract sense, a `PatientDatabase` lets you quickly retrieve all the events for a given patient ID. \n",
    "    * Internally, **piton** will create another set of indexes and files on disk that will be stored in a single folder, but you don't need to worry about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that everything is done on disk (i.e. not in memory), so you can work with arbitrarily large datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this means that you must specify the location of the folders where you want to store your `EventCollection`, `PatientCollection`, and `PatientDatabase` on disk."
